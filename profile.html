    <p>Biafra, officially the Republic of Biafra, was a state in West Africa that existed from May 1967 to January 1970. 
      It was made up of the states in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. Biafra's declaration of independence from Nigeria resulted in civil war between Biafra and Nigeria. 
      Biafra was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, and Zambia. Other nations did not give official recognition but provided support and assistance. 
      The Biafran government was led by Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, who served as its head of state. The capital city was Enugu.
